Prerequisites
=============

To use and/or contribute to PyBaMM, you must have Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9 installed.

To install Python 3 on Debian-based distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux
mint), open a terminal and run

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3

On Fedora or CentOS, you can use DNF or Yum. For example

.. code:: bash

   sudo dnf install python3

On Mac OS distributions, you can use ``homebrew``. First `install
brew <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/>`__:

.. code:: bash

   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

then follow instructions in link on adding brew to path, and run

.. code:: bash

   brew install python3

Install PyBaMM
==============

.. _user-install-label:

User install
------------

We recommend to install PyBaMM within a virtual environment, in order
not to alter any distribution python files.
First, make sure you are using python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9.
To create a virtual environment ``env`` within your current directory type:

.. code:: bash

   virtualenv env

You can then “activate” the environment using:

.. code:: bash

   source env/bin/activate

Now all the calls to pip described below will install PyBaMM and its
dependencies into the environment ``env``. When you are ready to exit
the environment and go back to your original system, just type:

.. code:: bash

   deactivate

PyBaMM can be installed via pip. On macOS, it is necessary to install the `SUNDIALS <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/>`__
library beforehand.

GNU/Linux and Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: bash

   pip install pybamm

macOS
~~~~~
.. code:: bash

   brew install sundials
   pip install pybamm

PyBaMM’s dependencies (such as ``numpy``, ``scipy``, etc) will be
installed automatically when you install PyBaMM using ``pip``.

For an introduction to virtual environments, see
(https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

.. _scikits.odes-label:

Optional - scikits.odes solver
------------------------------

Users can install `scikits.odes <https://github.com/bmcage/odes>`__ in
order to use the wrapped SUNDIALS ODE and DAE
`solvers <https://pybamm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/solvers/scikits_solvers.html>`__.
Currently, only GNU/Linux and macOS are supported.

GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

	  apt install libopenblas-dev
	  pybamm_install_odes

The ``pybamm_install_odes`` command is installed with PyBaMM. It automatically downloads and installs the SUNDIALS library on your
system (under ``~/.local``), before installing ``sckits.odes`` (by running ``pip install scikits.odes``).

macOS
~~~~~

.. code:: bash

	  pip install scikits.odes

Assuming that the SUNDIALS were installed as described :ref:`above<user-install-label>`.

Optional - JaxSolver
--------------------

Users can install ``jax`` and ``jaxlib`` to use the Jax solver.
Currently, only GNU/Linux and macOS are supported.

GNU/Linux and macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

	  pybamm_install_jax

The ``pybamm_install_jax`` command is installed with PyBaMM. It automatically downloads and installs jax and jaxlib on your system.

Developer install
-----------------

If you wish to contribute to PyBaMM, you should get the latest version
from the GitHub repository. To do so, you must have Git and graphviz
installed. For instance run

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install git graphviz

on Debian-based distributions, or

.. code:: bash

   brew install git graphviz

on Mac OS.

To install PyBaMM, the first step is to get the code by cloning this
repository

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM.git
   cd PyBaMM

Then, to install PyBaMM as a `developer <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__, type

 .. code:: bash

   pip install -e .[dev,docs]

To check whether PyBaMM has installed properly, you can run the tests:

.. code:: bash

   python3 run-tests.py --unit

Before you start contributing to PyBaMM, please read the `contributing
guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__.

Uninstall PyBaMM
================

PyBaMM can be uninstalled by running

.. code:: bash

   pip uninstall pybamm

in your virtual environment.

Troubleshooting
===============

**Problem:** I’ve made edits to source files in PyBaMM, but these are
not being used when I run my Python script.

**Solution:** Make sure you have installed PyBaMM using the ``-e`` flag,
i.e. ``pip install -e .``. This sets the installed location of the
source files to your current directory.

**Problem:** When running ``python run-tests.py --quick``, gives error
``FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'flake8': 'flake8``.

**Solution:** make sure you have included the ``[dev,docs]`` flags when
you pip installed PyBaMM, i.e. ``pip install -e .[dev,docs]``

**Problem:** Errors when solving model
``ValueError: Integrator name ida does not exsist``, or
``ValueError: Integrator name cvode does not exsist``.

**Solution:** This could mean that you have not installed
``scikits.odes`` correctly, check the instructions given above and make
sure each command was successful.

One possibility is that you have not set your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to
point to the sundials library, type ``echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and make
sure one of the directories printed out corresponds to where the
sundials libraries are located.

Another common reason is that you forget to install a BLAS library such
as OpenBLAS before installing sundials. Check the cmake output when you
configured Sundials, it might say:

::

   -- A library with BLAS API not found. Please specify library location.
   -- LAPACK requires BLAS

If this is the case, on a Debian or Ubuntu system you can install
OpenBLAS using ``sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev`` (or
``brew install openblas`` for Mac OS) and then re-install sundials using
the instructions above.
