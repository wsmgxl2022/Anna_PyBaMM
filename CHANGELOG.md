# [Unreleased](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/)

## Features

-   Added function `pybamm.get_git_commit_info()`, which returns information about the last git commit, useful for reproducibility ([#2293](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2293))
-   Added SEI model for composite electrodes ([#2290](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2290))
-   For experiments, the simulation now automatically checks and skips steps that cannot be performed (e.g. "Charge at 1C until 4.2V" from 100% SOC) ([#2212](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2212))

## Bug fixes

-   Added `SEI on cracks` to loop over all interfacial reactions ([#2262](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2262))
-   Fixed `X-averaged SEI on cracks concentration` so it's an average over x only, not y and z ([#2262](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2262))
-   Corrected initial state for SEI on cracks ([#2262](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2262))

## Optimizations

-   Default options for `particle mechanics` now dealt with differently in each electrode ([#2262](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2262))
-   Sped up calculations of Electrode SOH variables for summary variables ([#2210](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2210))

## Breaking changes

-   When creating a `pybamm.Interpolant` the default interpolator is now "linear". Passing data directly to `ParameterValues` using the ``[data]`` tag will be still used to create a cubic spline interpolant, as before ([#2258](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2258))
-   Events must now be defined in such a way that they are positive at the initial conditions (events will be triggered when they become negative, instead of when they change sign in either direction) ([#2212](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2212))

# [v22.8](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.8) - 2022-08-31

## Features

-   Added `CurrentSigmoidOpenCircuitPotential` model to model voltage hysteresis for charge/discharge ([#2256](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2256))
-   Added "Chen2020_composite" parameter set for a composite graphite/silicon electrode. ([#2256](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2256))
-   Added new cumulative variables `Throughput capacity [A.h]` and `Throughput energy [W.h]` to standard variables and summary variables, to assist with degradation studies. Throughput variables are only calculated if `calculate discharge energy` is set to `true`. `Time [s]` and `Time [h]` also added to summary variables. ([#2249](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2249))
-   Added `lipf6_OKane2022` electrolyte to `OKane2022` parameter set ([#2249](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2249))
-   Reformated submodel structure to allow composite electrodes. Composite positive electrode is now also possible. With current implementation, electrodes can have at most two phases. ([#2248](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2248))

## Bug fixes

-   Added new parameter `Ratio of lithium moles to SEI moles` (short name z_sei) to fix a bug where this number was incorrectly hardcoded to 1. ([#2222](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2222))
-   Changed short name of parameter `Inner SEI reaction proportion` from alpha_SEI to inner_sei_proportion, to avoid confusion with transfer coefficients. ([#2222](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2222))
-   Deleted legacy parameters with short names beta_sei and beta_plating. ([#2222](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2222))
-   Corrected initial SEI thickness for OKane2022 parameter set. ([#2218](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2218))

## Optimizations

-   Simplified scaling for the exchange-current density. The dimensionless parameter `C_r` is kept, but no longer used anywhere ([#2238](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2238))
-   Added limits for variables in some functions to avoid division by zero, sqrt(negative number), etc ([#2213](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2213))

## Breaking changes

-   Parameters specific to a (primary/secondary) phase in a domain are doubly nested. e.g. `param.c_n_max` is now `param.n.prim.c_max` ([#2248](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2248))

# [v22.7](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.7) - 2022-07-31

## Features 

-   Moved general code about submodels to `BaseModel` instead of `BaseBatteryModel`, making it easier to build custom models from submodels. ([#2169](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2169))
-   Events can now be plotted as a regular variable (under the name "Event: event_name", e.g. "Event: Minimum voltage [V]") ([#2158](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2158))
-   Added example showing how to print whether a model is compatible with a parameter set ([#2112](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2112))
-   Added SEI growth on cracks ([#2104](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2104))
-   Added Arrhenius temperature dependence of SEI growth ([#2104](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2104))
-   The "Inner SEI reaction proportion" parameter actually gets used now ([#2104](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2104))
-   New OKane2022 parameter set replaces Chen2020_plating ([#2104](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2104))
-   SEI growth, lithium plating and porosity change can now be set to distributed in `SPMe`. There is an additional option called `x-average side reactions` which allows to set this (note that for `SPM` it is always x-averaged). ([#2099](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2099))

## Optimizations

-   Improved eSOH calculations to be more robust ([#2192](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2192),[#2199](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2199))
-   The (2x2x2=8) particle diffusion submodels have been consolidated into just three submodels (Fickian diffusion, polynomial profile, and x-averaged polynomial profile) with optional x-averaging and size distribution. Polynomial profile and x-averaged polynomial profile are still two separate submodels, since they deal with surface concentration differently.
-   Added error for when solution vector gets too large, to help debug solver errors ([#2138](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2138))

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed error reporting for simulation with experiment ([#2213](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2213))
-   Fixed a bug in `Simulation` that caused initial conditions to change when solving an experiment multiple times ([#2204](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2204))
-   Fixed labels and ylims in `plot_voltage_components`([#2183](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2183))
-   Fixed 2D interpolant ([#2180](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2180))
-   Fixes a bug where the SPMe always builds even when `build=False` ([#2169](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2169))
-   Some events have been removed in the case where they are constant, i.e. can never be reached ([#2158](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2158))
-   Raise explicit `NotImplementedError` if trying to call `bool()` on a pybamm Symbol (e.g. in an if statement condition) ([#2141](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2141))
-   Fixed bug causing cut-off voltage to change after setting up a simulation with a model ([#2138](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2138))
-   A single solution cycle can now be used as a starting solution for a simulation ([#2138](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2138))

## Breaking changes

-   Exchange-current density functions (and some other functions) now take an additional argument, the maximum particle concentration for that phase ([#2134](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2134))
-   Loss of lithium to SEI on cracks is now a degradation variable, so setting a particle mechanics submodel is now compulsory (NoMechanics will suffice) ([#2104](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2104))

# [v22.6](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.6) - 2022-06-30

## Features

-   Added open-circuit potential as a separate submodel ([#2094](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2094))
-   Added partially reversible lithium plating model and new `OKane2022` parameter set to go with it ([#2043](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2043))
-   Added `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods for `Symbol` objects, using `.id` ([#1978](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1978))

## Optimizations

-   Stoichiometry inputs to OCP functions are now bounded between 1e-10 and 1-1e-10, with singularities at 0 and 1 so that OCP goes to +- infinity ([#2095](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2095))

## Breaking changes

-   Changed some dictionary keys to `Symbol` instead of `Symbol.id` (internal change only, should not affect external facing functions) ([#1978](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1978))

# [v22.5](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.5) - 2022-05-31

## Features

-   Added functionality to generate Julia expressions from a model. See [PyBaMM.jl](https://github.com/tinosulzer/PyBaMM.jl) for how to use these ([#1942](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1942)))
-   Added basic callbacks to the Simulation class, and a LoggingCallback ([#1880](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1880)))

## Bug fixes

-   Corrected legend order in "plot_voltage_components.py", so each entry refers to the correct overpotential. ([#2061](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2061))

## Breaking changes

-   Changed domain-specific parameter names to a nested attribute. `param.n.l_n` is now `param.n.l` ([#2063](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2063))

# [v22.4](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.4) - 2022-04-30

## Features

-   Added a casadi version of the IDKLU solver, which is used for `model.convert_to_format = "casadi"` ([#2002](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2002))

## Bug fixes

-   Remove old deprecation errors, including those in `parameter_values.py` that caused the simulation if, for example, the reaction rate is re-introduced manually ([#2022](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2022))

# [v22.3](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.3) - 2022-03-31

## Features

-   Added "Discharge energy [W.h]", which is the integral of the power in Watts, as an optional output. Set the option "calculate discharge energy" to "true" to get this output ("false" by default, since it can slow down some of the simple models) ([#1969](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1969)))
-   Added an option "calculate heat source for isothermal models" to choose whether or not the heat generation terms are computed when running models with the option `thermal="isothermal"`  ([#1958](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1958))

## Optimizations

-   Simplified `model.new_copy()` ([#1977](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1977))

## Bug fixes

-   Fix bug where sensitivity calculation failed if len of `calculate_sensitivities` was less than `inputs` ([#1897](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1897))
-   Fixed a bug in the eSOH variable calculation when OCV is given as data ([#1975](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1975))
-   Fixed a bug where isothermal models did not compute any heat source terms ([#1958](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1958))

## Breaking changes

-   Removed `model.new_empty_copy()` (use `model.new_copy()` instead) ([#1977](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1977))
-   Dropped support for Windows 32-bit architecture ([#1964](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1964))

# [v22.2](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.2) - 2022-02-28

## Features

-   Isothermal models now calculate heat source terms (but the temperature remains constant). The models now also account for current collector heating when `dimensionality=0` ([#1929](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1929))
-   Added new models for power control and resistance control ([#1917](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1917))

-   Parameters can now be imported from a directory having "pybamm" in its name ([#1919](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1919))
-   `scikit.odes` and `SUNDIALS` can now be installed using `pybamm_install_odes` ([#1916](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1916))

## Breaking changes

-   The `domain` setter and `auxiliary_domains` getter have been deprecated, `domains` setter/getter should be used instead. The `domain` getter is still active. We now recommend creating symbols with `domains={...}` instead of `domain=..., auxiliary_domains={...}`, but the latter is not yet deprecated ([#1866](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1866))

# [v22.1](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v22.1) - 2022-01-31

## Optimizations

-   The `Symbol` nodes no longer subclasses `anytree.NodeMixIn`. This removes some checks that were not really needed ([#1912](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1912))

## Bug fixes

-   Parameters can now be imported from any given path in `Windows` ([#1900](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1900))
-   Fixed initial conditions for the EC SEI model ([#1895](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1895))

-   Added fitted expressions for OCPs for the Chen2020 parameter set ([#1526](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1497))
-   Added `initial_soc` argument to `Simualtion.solve` for specifying the initial SOC when solving a model ([#1512](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1512))
-   Added `print_name` to some symbols ([#1495](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1495), [#1497](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1497))
-   Added Base Parameters class and SymPy in dependencies ([#1495](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1495))
-   Added a new "reaction-driven" model for LAM from Reniers et al (2019) ([#1490](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1490))
-   Some features ("loss of active material" and "particle mechanics") can now be specified separately for the negative electrode and positive electrode by passing a 2-tuple ([#1490](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1490))

-   Added "summary variables" to track degradation over several cycles ([#1459](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1459))
-   Added `ElectrodeSOH` model for calculating capacities and stoichiometric limits ([#1459](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1459))
-   Added Batch Study class ([#1455](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1455))
-   Added `ConcatenationVariable`, which is automatically created when variables are concatenated ([#1453](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1453))
-   Added "fast with events" mode for the CasADi solver, which solves a model and finds events more efficiently than "safe" mode. As of PR #1450 this feature is still being tested and "safe" mode remains the default ([#1450](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1450))

## Optimizations

-   Models that mostly use x-averaged quantities (SPM and SPMe) now use x-averaged degradation models ([#1490](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1490))

-   Updated documentation to include some previously missing functions, such as `erf` and `tanh` ([#1628](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1628))
-   Fixed reading citation file without closing ([#1620](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1620))

-   Made parameters importable through pybamm ([#1475](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1475))

## Breaking changes

-   Refactored the `particle` submodel module, with the models having no size distribution now found in `particle.no_distribution`, and those with a size distribution in `particle.size_distribution`. Renamed submodels to indicate the transport model (Fickian diffusion, polynomial profile) and if they are "x-averaged". E.g., `FickianManyParticles` and `FickianSingleParticle` are now `no_distribution.FickianDiffusion` and `no_distribution.XAveragedFickianDiffusion` ([#1602](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1602))
-   Changed sensitivity API. Removed `ProcessedSymbolicVariable`, all sensitivity now handled within the solvers and `ProcessedVariable` ([#1552](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1552),[#2276](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2276))
-   The `Yang2017` parameter set has been removed as the complete parameter set is not publicly available in the literature ([#1577](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1577))
-   Changed how options are specified for the "loss of active material" and "particle cracking" submodels. "loss of active material" can now be one of "none", "stress-driven", or "reaction-driven", or a 2-tuple for different options in negative and positive electrode. Similarly "particle cracking" (now called "particle mechanics") can now be "none", "swelling only", "swelling and cracking", or a 2-tuple ([#1490](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1490))
-   Changed the variable in the full diffusion model from "Electrolyte concentration" to "Porosity times concentration" ([#1476](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1476))
-   Renamed `lithium-ion` folder to `lithium_ion` and `lead-acid` folder to `lead_acid` in parameters ([#1464](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1464))

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v0.4.0) - 2021-03-28

This release introduces:
- several new models, including reversible and irreversible plating submodels, submodels for loss of active material, Yang et al.'s (2017) coupled SEI/plating/pore clogging model, and the Newman-Tobias model
- internal optimizations for solving models, particularly for simulating experiments, with more accurate event detection and more efficient numerical methods and post-processing
- parallel solutions of a model with different inputs
- a cleaner installation process for Mac when installing from PyPI, no longer requiring a Homebrew installation of Sundials
- improved plotting functionality, including adding a new 'voltage component' plot
- several other new features, optimizations, and bug fixes, summarized below

## Features
-   Added `NewmanTobias` li-ion battery model ([#1423](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1423))
-   Added `plot_voltage_components` to easily plot the component overpotentials that make up the voltage ([#1419](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1419))
-   Made `QuickPlot` more customizable and added an example ([#1419](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1419))
-   `Solution` objects can now be created by stepping *different* models ([#1408](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1408))
-   Added Yang et al 2017 model that couples irreversible lithium plating, SEI growth and change in porosity which produces a transition from linear to nonlinear degradation pattern of lithium-ion battery over extended cycles([#1398](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1398))
-   Added support for Python 3.9 and dropped support for Python 3.6. Python 3.6 may still work but is now untested ([#1370](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1370))
-   Added the electrolyte overpotential and Ohmic losses for full conductivity, including surface form ([#1350](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1350))
-   Added functionality to `Citations` to print formatted citations ([#1340](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1340))
-   Updated the way events are handled in `CasadiSolver` for more accurate event location ([#1328](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1328))
-   Added error message if initial conditions are outside the bounds of a variable ([#1326](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1326))
-   Added temperature dependence to density, heat capacity and thermal conductivity ([#1323](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1323))
-   Added temperature dependence to the transference number (`t_plus`) ([#1317](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1317))
-   Added new functionality for `Interpolant` ([#1312](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1312))
-   Added option to express experiments (and extract solutions) in terms of cycles of operating condition ([#1309](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1309))
-   The event time and state are now returned as part of `Solution.t` and `Solution.y` so that the event is accurately captured in the returned solution ([#1300](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1300))
-   Added reversible and irreversible lithium plating models ([#1287](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1287))
-   Reformatted the `BasicDFNHalfCell` to be consistent with the other models ([#1282](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1282))
-   Added option to make the total interfacial current density a state ([#1280](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1280))
-   Added functionality to initialize a model using the solution from another model ([#1278](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1278))
-   Added submodels for active material ([#1262](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1262))
-   Updated solvers' method `solve()` so it can take a list of inputs dictionaries as the `inputs` keyword argument. In this case the model is solved for each input set in the list, and a list of solutions mapping the set of inputs to the solutions is returned. Note that `solve()` can still take a single dictionary as the `inputs` keyword argument. In this case the behaviour is unchanged compared to previous versions.([#1261](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1261))
-   Added composite surface form electrolyte models: `CompositeDifferential` and `CompositeAlgebraic` ([#1207](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/issues/1207))

## Optimizations

-   Improved the way an `Experiment` is simulated to reduce solve time (at the cost of slightly higher set-up time) ([#1408](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1408))
-   Add script and workflow to automatically update parameter_sets.py docstrings ([#1371](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1371))
-   Add URLs checker in workflows ([#1347](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1347))
-   The `Solution` class now only creates the concatenated `y` when the user asks for it. This is an optimization step as the concatenation can be slow, especially with larger experiments ([#1331](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1331))
-   If solver method `solve()` is passed a list of inputs as the `inputs` keyword argument, the resolution of the model for each input set is spread across several Python processes, usually running in parallel on different processors. The default number of processes is the number of processors available. `solve()` takes a new keyword argument `nproc` which can be used to set this number a manually.
-   Variables are now post-processed using CasADi ([#1316](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1316))
-   Operations such as `1*x` and `0+x` now directly return `x` ([#1252](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1252))

## Bug fixes

-   Fixed a bug on the boundary conditions of `FickianSingleParticle` and `FickianManyParticles` to ensure mass is conserved ([#1421](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1421))
-   Fixed a bug where the `PolynomialSingleParticle` submodel gave incorrect results with "dimensionality" equal to 2 ([#1411](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1411))
-   Fixed a bug where volume averaging in 0D gave the wrong result ([#1411](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1411))
-   Fixed a sign error in the positive electrode ohmic losses ([#1407](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1407))
-   Fixed the formulation of the EC reaction SEI model ([#1397](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1397))
-   Simulations now stop when an experiment becomes infeasible ([#1395](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1395))
-   Added a check for domains in `Concatenation` ([#1368](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1368))
-   Differentiation now works even when the differentiation variable is a constant ([#1294](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1294))
-   Fixed a bug where the event time and state were no longer returned as part of the solution ([#1344](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1344))
-   Fixed a bug in `CasadiSolver` safe mode which crashed when there were extrapolation events but no termination events ([#1321](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1321))
-   When an `Interpolant` is extrapolated an error is raised for `CasadiSolver` (and a warning is raised for the other solvers) ([#1315](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1315))
-   Fixed `Simulation` and `model.new_copy` to fix a bug where changes to the model were overwritten ([#1278](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1278))

## Breaking changes

-   Removed `Simplification` class and `.simplify()` function ([#1369](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1369))
-   All example notebooks in PyBaMM's GitHub repository must now include the command `pybamm.print_citations()`, otherwise the tests will fail. This is to encourage people to use this command to cite the relevant papers ([#1340](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1340))
-   Notation has been homogenised to use positive and negative electrode (instead of cathode and anode). This applies to the parameter folders (now called `'positive_electrodes'` and `'negative_electrodes'`) and the options of `active_material` and `particle_cracking` submodels (now called `'positive'` and `'negative'`) ([#1337](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1337))
-   `Interpolant` now takes `x` and `y` instead of a single `data` entry ([#1312](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1312))
-   Boolean model options ('sei porosity change', 'convection') must now be given in string format ('true' or 'false' instead of True or False) ([#1280](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1280))
-   Operations such as `1*x` and `0+x` now directly return `x`. This can be bypassed by explicitly creating the binary operators, e.g. `pybamm.Multiplication(1, x)` ([#1252](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1252))
-   `'Cell capacity [A.h]'` has been renamed to `'Nominal cell capacity [A.h]'`. `'Cell capacity [A.h]'` will be deprecated in the next release. ([#1352](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1352))

# [v0.3.0](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/v0.3.0) - 2020-12-01

-   Fix bug that was slowing down creation of the EC reaction SEI submodel ([#1227](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1227))
-   Add missing separator thermal parameters for the Ecker parameter set ([#1226](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1226))

-   Raise error if the boundary condition at the origin in a spherical domain is other than no-flux ([#1175](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1175))
-   Fix boundary conditions at r = 0 for Creating Models notebooks ([#1173](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1173))

## Breaking changes

-    The parameters "Positive/Negative particle distribution in x" and "Positive/Negative surface area to volume ratio distribution in x" have been deprecated. Instead, users can provide "Positive/Negative particle radius [m]" and "Positive/Negative surface area to volume ratio [m-1]" directly as functions of through-cell position (x [m]) ([#1237](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/1237))
