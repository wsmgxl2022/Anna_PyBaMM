    "# Tutorial 8 - Solver options\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Tutorial 7](./Tutorial%207%20-%20Model%20options.ipynb) we saw how to change the model options. In this tutorial we will show how to pass options to the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models in PyBaMM have a default solver which is typically different depending on whether the model results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or differential algebraic equations (DAEs). \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common options you will want to change is the solver tolerances. By default all tolerances are set to $10^{-6}$. However, depending on your simulation you may find you want to tighten the tolerances to obtain a more accurate solution, or you may want to loosen the tolerances to reduce the solve time. It is good practice to conduct a tolerance study, where you simulate the same problem with a tighter tolerances and compare the results. We do not show how to do this here, but we give an example of a mesh resolution study in the [next tutorial](./Tutorial%209%20-%20Changing%20the%20mesh.ipynb), which is conducted in a similar way."

    "The `CasadiSolver` can operate in a number of modes, including \"safe\" (default) and \"fast\". Safe mode performs step-and-check integration and supports event handling (e.g. you can integrate until you hit a certain voltage), and is the recommended for simulations of a full charge or discharge. Fast mode performs direct integration, ignoring events, and is recommended when simulating a drive cycle or other simulation where no events should be triggered.\n",

    "We'll solve the DFN with all the default options in both \"safe\" and \"fast\" mode and compare the solutions. For both simulations we'll use $10^{-3}$ for both the absolute and relative tolerance. For demonstration purposes we'll change the cut-off voltage to 3.6V so we can observe the different behaviour of the two solver modes."
