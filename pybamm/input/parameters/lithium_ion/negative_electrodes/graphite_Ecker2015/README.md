# Graphite negative electrode parameters

Parameters for a graphite negative electrode, from the papers:

> Ecker, Madeleine, et al. "Parameterization of a physico-chemical model of a lithium-ion battery I. determination of parameters." Journal of the Electrochemical Society 162.9 (2015): A1836-A1848.

> Ecker, Madeleine, et al. "Parameterization of a physico-chemical model of a lithium-ion battery II. Model validation." Journal of The Electrochemical Society 162.9 (2015): A1849-A1857.

The fits to data for the electrode and electrolyte properties are those provided
by Dr. Simon Oâ€™Kane in the paper:

> Richardson, Giles, et. al. "Generalised single particle models for high-rate operation of graded lithium-ion electrodes: Systematic derivation and validation." Electrochemica Acta 339 (2020): 135862

The thermal material properties are for a 5 Ah power pouch cell by Kokam. The data are extracted from

> Zhao, Y., et al. "Modeling the effects of thermal gradients induced by tab and surface cooling on lithium ion cell performance."" Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 165.13 (2018): A3169-A3178.
